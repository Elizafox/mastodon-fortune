"huge companies impacted by new strain of ransomware. the world is collapsing,
millions doomed" I HEAR DISTANTLY EMANATING FROM ACROSS THE ROOM AS I GAZE OUT
THE WINDOW, ABSENT OF THOUGHT AND FEELING. MOMENTARILY, I INDULGE IN A TOBACCO
DELIGHT. THE FEELING OF THE LUKEWARM PLASTIC FROM MY LUXURIOUS, GOLDEN, OPERA
LENGTH CIGARETTE HOLDER CARESSES MY LIPS. IN A SOFT, VELVET VOICE, I MUTTER
"Yes, of course. It seems tragedy has invited itself into our humble existence."

NO MORE IS SAID.
