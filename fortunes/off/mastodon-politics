Communism is living with dirty people in a field while knitting hats and
democracy is only ever playing the demo versions of games and they both sound
pretty awful tbh.

Wouldn't it be great if the lawyers of the Internet took a short break from
attacking teenagers for downloading music, and instead put a little bit of
attention towards the spam and ads industry? I keep hearing that most of the
spam comes from just a few sources -- a botnet here, a server there. It's
basically one big mafiah. But I guess there is no money in stopping that.

if anyone tries to tell you we are creatures driven purely by rationality and
markets, they are fucking lying to you and their philosophy is full of shit.
